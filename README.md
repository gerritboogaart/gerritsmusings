# newweatherapp

To run the code: npm run dev
This will concurrently start the server and the React app.

This project was built with ReactJS and a NodeJS Express server.

This app is served on Heroku.

All apps were made with ReactJS.

Apps in this portfolio:
- Blog: React with Hooks and Context
- WeatherApp: React with reChartJS, nodeJS, express and axios in the backened. I use data from darksky to get the data and google maps to get the location.
- Blocks: Javascript and CSS3 to make the blocks fall and to remove blocks. I use localStorage to store the highscore.
- Photos: React and Google maps to display the photos and the location where the photos were taken
