# Gerrits Musings

To run the code: npm run dev
This will concurrently start the server and the React app.

This project was built with ReactJS and a NodeJS Express server.

This app is served on Heroku.

All apps were made with ReactJS.

Apps in this portfolio:
- Blog: React with Hooks and Context
- Weather: React with reChartJS, NodeJS, Axpress and axios in the back end. I use data from Darksky to get the data and Google maps to get the location.
- Blocks: JavaScript and CSS3 to animate the blocks. I use localStorage to store the high score.
- Photos: React and Google maps to display the photos and the location where the photos were taken
